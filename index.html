			<h1>Best Movies of all times:</h1>
	    	<p>From Willow Creek to the 'emerging church,' from the Southern Baptist Convention to the National Association of Evangelicals, folks are realizing that the four walls of the church are too small for a big God.God is still speaking. Let's come together - Protestant and Catholic, Muslim and Hindu and Jew, believer and non-believer alike. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow. To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, and to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, and recognize Israel's right to exist. Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state; to recognize Israel's legitimacy; and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.

			<p>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands. And throughout history, Islam has demonstrated through words and deeds the possibilities of religious tolerance and racial equality. So let there be no doubt: the situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. The Internet and television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence. Fear that because of modernity we will lose of control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly our identities - those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions, and our faith.</p>

			<p>Hope in the face of uncertainty. The President vetoed a similar plan, but he doesn't have the last word, and we're going to keep at it, until we bring this war to an end. But as Americans, we also know that this is a nation of laws, and we cannot have those laws broken when more than 2,000 people cross our borders illegally every day. "People began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend's voice up into the rafters....And in that single note - hope! - I heard something else; at the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion's den, Ezekiel's field of dry bones. And I am hopeful that all countries in the region can share in this goal.</p>

			<p>And when these battles were overtaken by others and when the wars they opposed were waged and won, these faithful foot soldiers for justice kept marching. For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else. It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot. Denying that fact is baseless, ignorant, and hateful.</p>

			<p>There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America - there's the United States of America. They cheered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial when Dr. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead.</p>
